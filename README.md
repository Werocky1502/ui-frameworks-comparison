# Blazor VS Angular VS React

> Each section will contain a short description of the framework.
I will cover the history of creation, age (amount of versions?), popularity, community info and examples of popular sites built with this framework. I'll try to add a short overview of inner architecture. I think it is impossible to give an overview of the framework without code examples so I will try to create a simple application with all of them.
